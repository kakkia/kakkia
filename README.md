ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @kakkia
 
I love to sit on my computer and discover new programs I can use to create products. 

I developed my first interactive web-documentary without knowing a single line of code, just because I wanted to help a journalist building his own portfolio, and I liked his work. 

That's what I believe in: continuous learning and improvement through a lot of practice. I like to be ready when an opportunity presents itself, and updating my skills is key to succeeding. 

I have been training in Data Science and working with Python and SQL, learning about Data Analysis, Data Visualization, Data Engineering and Machine Learning and looking for a new career path to take.
